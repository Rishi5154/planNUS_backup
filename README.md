## Motivation

Given the age where we have a wide range of classes and events to attend, keeping track of events which we have to attend can be a burden on the memory. Sometimes, we also fail to prioritise our schedule properly. In addition, the hectic lifestyles make it difficult for us to find common free time together, whether it is for leisure activities or a formal meeting. It is also a hassle to manually look for free time with someone.


## And that's where planNUS steps in!

We aim to make event planning easy for students and academic staff by giving them in-depth info about events relevant to them as well as proffering them suggestions on what they could do as well as expediting the process of organising mutual events among themselves. In addition, we aim to ease the process of finding mutually convenient time with any user of the application.


## Instructions for use
1. Ensure that you have the latest version of __Flutter__ installed on your systems. For more details, please refer to https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install to get started.
2. Do a __clone__ of this repository with `git clone https://github.com/Rishi5154/planNUS_backup` in an empty directory.
3. Ensure that you have an __Android emulator__ installed. This app is specifically designed for __Android__ only, as of now. We highly recommend downloading Android Studio  at https://developer.android.com/studio/?gclid=CjwKCAjw9vn4BRBaEiwAh0muDJlTH_UKSMsapmTlXwHkQw33H-er42iOt5gh1x_4WasJBNQo6Cg7rBoCf9MQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds.
4. On Android Studio, download the __Flutter__ & __Dart__ plugins.
5. Go to __Tools > AVD Manager > Create Virtual Device__
5. Download the __Pixel XL API R emulator__, as well as the android SDK alongside, preferably API level 28/29 & follow up with the installation processes.
6. Once done, restart the IDE. If you get an pop-up to configure for Android, do activate that as well.
7. Start up the emulator by selecting Pixel XL API R from the top central panel that is placed onside with a blue smartphone icon.
8. From there, you can search for plannusandroid app on the Home screen and you're good to go.

_Note of caution, the Google Sign In option may not work as intended for your device, as its unique SHA key will need to be added onto our Firebase configuration._
